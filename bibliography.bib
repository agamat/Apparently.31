abstract = {The Bearish Sentiment Index--the ratio of the number of investment advisers who are bearish to the total number of advisers who are either bearish or bullish--is promoted as a contrary indicator. That is, one should buy when investment advisers are bearish and sell when they are bullish. But is the Bearish Sentiment Index useful? Examination of the data from January 1963 (when the index was first compiled) to September 1985 indicates that the index is useless as an indicator of forthcoming stock price changes. The number of correct forecasts by the index is equaled by the number of incorrect forecasts. If the Bearish Sentiment Index is useless, why do people continue to use it? The persistence of the belief in the usefulness of the index results from errors in cognition that lead people to see patterns in random data and to neglect evidence that runs counter to their beliefs.

        Aims/Objectives 
        

        
The aim of the paper to introduce another approach to consider in the finance instead of the traditional approace which is the efficient market hypotheis. The new approace is a Noise Trader approach.

        
          
Key concepts used

        
        
The assumptions behind the approache are 1- There are not rational investors in the market who do not trade on fundamental news.
2- Arbitrage is risky, so arbitragures can not push the prices to its fundamental values again.
          

          
Research Methods
        

        
it is only theoritical paper

        
          
Analysis / Results
        

        
Noise tarders rise a cost for the community on both public and privatre aspect. Some proposals asks government should make something towards that such as rising capital gains and the other is transactions cost.

        
          

          
Any other comment: 
        

        
Three reasons in favor for the approach

        
1- Limited arbitrage is more plausible than perfect arbitrage
2- The investor sentiment approach yeilds a more accurate description of financial markets than the efficient market paradigm.
3- the new approace yields more testable impilications about asset prices.

The theory implies that discounts on various funds move together, that new funds get started when seasoned funds sell at a premium or a small discount, and that discounts are correlated with prices of other securities affected by the same investor sentiment. The evidence supports these predictions. In particular, we find that both closed-end funds and small stocks tend to be held by individual investors, and that the discounts on closed-end funds narrow when small stocks do well.

Key concepts used        
        
        Compairing the two types of funds; the equity fund and the fixed income fund. If the fised income fund is exposed to the same sentiment it should has a premium.

        Analysis / Results
          
                this paper argues that if discount is related to the sentiment from noise trader, so their should be a differenc ebetween the equity and bond funds in their relationship with risk. However, bond and stock funds are exposed to the same degree of systematic risks and this may assure that discount puzzle could not be solved only by sentiment explanation.

abstract = {A sample of closed-end bond funds is examined to investigate several hypotheses purporting to explain closed-end fund discounts. Consistent with Brickley, Manaster and Schallheim (1991), unrealized capital appreciation is found to be negatively related to the discount. Support also is found for the investor sentiment hypothesis of Lee, Shleifer, and Thaler (1991). Fund expense, a proxy for agency-related issues, and holdings of foreign securities, are found to be positively related to the discount. Two proxies for the investor allocation decision: the slope of the yield curve, and differential returns between stocks and bonds, are significant in the directions expected. No significant relationships are found between investments in either restricted securities or large outside blockholdings and the discount. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Investigating this anomaly, we find that individual fund premiums move together, primarily because of the comovement of their stock prices with the U.S. market. Moreover, an index of country fund premiums differentiates size-ranked U.S. portfolio returns and forecasts country fund stock returns. These findings suggest that international equity prices are affected by local risk.

Using weekly data during the 1986-8 period and conventional measures of stock fundamentals, changes in fundamentals are found to have a statistically significant influence on the movement of stock prices. In addition, a much-discussed measure of investor sentiment is used to test the proposition that investor sentiment contributed to the stock market crash of 1987. However, insignificant results regarding the investor sentiment index suggest that either the recently proposed sentiment index is faulty or investor sentiment did not significantly influence stock prices in the period surrounding the 1987 crash.},

abstract = {We propose a theory of securities market under- and overreactions based on two well-known psychological biases: investor overconfidence about the precision of private information; and biased self-attribution, which causes asymmetric shifts in investors' confidence as a function of their investment outcomes. We show that overconfidence implies negative long-lag autocorrelations, excess volatility, and, when managerial actions are correlated with stock mispricing, public-event-based return predictability. Biased self-attribution adds positive short-lag autocorrelations ("momentum"), short-run earnings "drift," but negative correlation between future returns and long-term past stock market and accounting performance. The theory also offers several untested implications and implications for corporate financial policy. CR - Copyright \&\#169; 1998 American Finance Association},

Using data from 1933 to 1993, we find that fund discounts and net redemptions predict the size premium, the difference between small and large firm returns, but little evidence that the odd-lot ratio predicts returns.},

The paper explores changes in bubble expectations and investor confidence among institutional investors in the U.S. stock market at six-month intervals for the period 1989 to 1998 and for individual investors at the start and end of this period. Based on the results of the questionnaires administered during the period, the author develops specific time-series indicators for each of the following: a speculative bubble (an unstable situation with expectations for a increase in the short term only), a negative speculative bubble (an unstable situation with expectations for a downturn in the short term only), and investor confidence (a feeling that nothing can go wrong). Using the indicators, the author produces indexes indicating the average percentage of the population at a given time with bubble expectations, negative bubble expectations, and investor confidence, respectively.},

abstract = {Steep declines in the value of publicly traded stocks in the first quarter of 2001 left many market observers speculating whether investor sentiment had undergone a significant and negative change, and whether investors would subsequently flee stocks in favor of less volatile investment options. A survey study of investor expectations and confidence was conducted in late March 2001 to capture investor sentiment and compare it with similar measures taken in surveys conducted in 1998 during a period of rapid market incline. The surprising results are that there are only minor differences in investor sentiment in terms of: (a) confidence in the long and intermediate performance of the stock markets; (b) composition of stocks versus bonds in their portfolios; (c) the intention to buy on the dips; (d) the amount of risk investors plan to undertake. The high level of investor confidence observed in 2001 (in spite of a severe drop in market value) is potentially accounted for by psychological processes that influence investor judgment. These processes include reliance on image-driven affective evaluations of common stocks that contribute to excessive optimism.},

The average IPO leaves \$9.1 million on the table. This number is approximately twice as large as the fees paid to investment bankers and represents a substantial indirect cost to the issuing firm. We present a prospect theory model that focuses on the covariance of the money left on the table and wealth changes. Our reasoning also provides an explanation for a second puzzling pattern: much more money is left on the table following recent market rises than after market falls. This results in an explanation of hot issue markets. We also offer a new explanation for why IPOs are underpriced.},

To augment, or substitute for deficiencies in, such data, property investors may turn to perceptions of investor or market sentiment. Reliance on sentiment in the wider financial markets is, however, regarded as suboptimal behaviour that leads to mispricing. Discussion of these contrasting views of sentiment is coupled with the results from a survey of property investment decision-makers. These results indicate that investor sentiment is an important factor in property decision-making, despite its neglect in formal explanations of property market functioning. The conception of investor sentiment held by survey respondents is explored and confirmed as different to the concept applied in the wider financial markets.},

Using this common component as a measure of individual investor sentiment, we show that it is weakly correlated with standard risk factors and macro-economic variables, and is strongly influenced by expert advice from investment newsletters. Moreover, this sentiment mea-sure has incremental explanatory power for small-cap returns, particularly among stocks with lower prices, lower institutional ownership, and higher B/M ratios.

abstract = {We find evidence that is consistent with the hypothesis that daily mutual fund flows may be instruments for investor sentiment about the stock market. We use this finding to construct a new index of investor sentiment, and validate this index using data from both the United States and Japan. In both markets exposure to this factor is priced, and in the Japanese case, we document evidence of negative correlations between Bull' and Bear' domestic funds. The flows to bear foreign funds in Japan display some evidence of negative correlation to domestic and foreign equity funds, suggesting that there is a foreign vs. domestic sentiment factor in Japan that does not appear in the contemporaneous U.S. data. By contrast, U.S. mutual fund investors appear to regard domestic and foreign equity mutual funds as economic substitutes.},

Because nine-eleven was a sudden, unforeseen, and significantly negative and exogenous shock to the world, the capital markets, and investor sentiment, our test avoids many of the problems of extant studies. Discounts worsened dramatically following the event, and then recovered alongside the broader market. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that discounts reflect the sentiment of small investors, who took their cues from the broader market's overall movement. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {This paper compares investor sentiment measures based on consumer confidence surveys with measures extracted from the closed-end fund discount (CEFD). Our evidence suggests that these two kinds of sentiment measures do not correlate well with one another. For a short 2 - 4 year period in which we have direct investor sentiment survey data from UBS/Gallup, only the consumer confidence correlates well with investor sentiment. Further, only the consumer confidence based measure can robustly explain the small-firm return spread and the return spread between stocks held disproportionately by retail investors and those held by institutional investors. Surprisingly, there is even a hint that the consumer confidence measure can explain closed-end fund IPO activity, while the CEFD cannot. In sum, our evidence supports the view that sentiment plays a role in financial markets, but that the CEFD may be the wrong measure of sentiment.},

This method enables us to evaluate if there is herding towards particular sectors or styles in the market including the market index itself and critically we can also separate such herding from common movements in asset returns induced by movements in fundamentals. We apply the approach to an analysis of herding in the US and South Korean stock markets and find that herding towards the market shows significant movements and persistence independently from and given market conditions and macro factors. We find evidence of herding towards the market portfolio in both bull and bear markets. Contrary to common belief, the Asian Crisis and in particular the Russian Crisis reduce herding and are clearly identified as turning points in herding behaviour.},

abstract = {We study how stock market mispricing might influence individual firms' investment decisions. We find a positive relation between investment and a number of proxies for mispricing, controlling for investment opportunities and financial slack, suggesting that overpriced (underpriced) firms tend to overinvest (underinvest). Consistent with the predictions of our model, we find that investment is more sensitive to our mispricing proxies for firms with higher R\&D intensity suggesting longer periods of information asymmetry and thus mispricing) or share turnover (suggesting that the firms' shareholders are short-term investors). We also find that firms with relatively high (low) investment subsequently have relatively low (high) stock returns, after controlling for investment opportunities and other characteristics linked to return predictability. These patterns are stronger for firms with higher R\&D intensity or higher share turnover.},

abstract = {We examined the impact of specific emotions on the endowment effect, the tendency for selling prices to exceed buying or "choice" prices for the same object. As predicted by appraisal-tendency theory, disgust induced by a prior, irrelevant situation carried over to normatively unrelated economic decisions, reducing selling and choice prices and eliminating the endowment effect. Sadness also carried over, reducing selling prices but increasing choice prices--producing a "reverse endowment effect" in which choice prices exceeded selling prices. The results demonstrate that incidental emotions can influence decisions even when real money is at stake, and that emotions of the same valence can have opposing effects on such decisions.},

abstract = {This paper examines the relationship between net aggregate equity fund flow and investor sentiment using weekly flow data. Using sentiment indicators from the American Association of Individual Investors and Investors Intelligence, I find that net aggregate equity fund flow in the current week is higher when individual investors became more bullish in the previous and current weeks. Moreover, higher net aggregate equity fund flow in the current week induces newsletter writers to become more bullish in the subsequent week. The relationship between net aggregate equity fund flow and investor sentiment remains strong even after accounting for the effects of risk premium and inflation. Overall, the evidence suggests that the behavior of equity fund investors is influenced not only by economic fundamentals, but also by investor sentiment.},

abstract = {We build a model that helps to explain why increases in liquidity—such as lower bid–ask spreads, a lower price impact of trade, or higher turnover–predict lower subsequent returns in both firm-level and aggregate data. The model features a class of irrational investors, who underreact to the information contained in order flow, thereby boosting liquidity. In the presence of short-sales constraints, high liquidity is a symptom of the fact that the market is dominated by these irrational investors, and hence is overvalued. This theory can also explain how managers might successfully time the market for seasoned equity offerings, by simply following a rule of thumb that involves issuing when the SEO market is particularly liquid. Empirically, we find that: (i) aggregate measures of equity issuance and share turnover are highly correlated; yet (ii) in a multiple regression, both have incremental predictive power for future equal-weighted market returns.},

In light of earlier work (Campbell 1991, Vuolteenaho 2002) which finds that aggregate stock returns are less informative about future cashflows than are firm-level stock returns--and thus, potentially more strongly influenced by investor sentiment--these results suggest that both equity issuance and mergers are to a significant extent driven by market-timing considerations, as opposed to by purely fundamental factors.},

We present a microstructure model of the foreign exchange market based on technical trading that allows us to categorize the de facto exchange rate regimes and derive a market-based measure of the credibility of these exchange rate regimes. Our empirical results indicate that in the run-up to EU accession, most Central and Eastern European countries enjoyed high credibility in their exchange rate management. However, some of these future Economic and Monetary Union participants will have to strengthen their efforts and further focus their exchange rate policy on stabilizing the euro exchange rate.

If excessive optimism drives prices above intrinsic values, periods of high sentiment should be followed by low returns, as market prices revert to fundamental values. Using survey data on investor sentiment, we provide evidence that sentiment affects asset valuation. Market pricing errors implied by an independent valuation model are positively related to sentiment. Future returns over multiyear horizons are negatively related to sentiment. These results are robust to the inclusion of other variables that have been shown to forecast stock returns. CR - Copyright \&\#169; 2005 The University of Chicago Press},

We estimate the components of consumer confidence related to economic fundamentals and investor sentiment. After controlling for the time variation of beta, we study the time-series variation of the pricing error with sentiment. Over the last 25 years, investor sentiment measured using consumer confidence forecasts the returns of small stocks and stocks with low institutional ownership in a manner consistent with the predictions of models based on noise-trader sentiment. Sentiment does not appear to forecast time-series variation in the value and momentum premiums. (JEL G10, G12, G14)},

abstract = {This study investigates the relative importance of “pull” and “push” factors in determining portfolio investment flows to Asian and Latin American economies. The market's attitude toward risk is included as a “push” factor. The study finds that factors that pull and push foreign portfolio investment (PI) differ between Asian and Latin American economies. PI in Asia was dominantly pushed by investors’ appetite for risk and other external factors while favorable domestic economic conditions had a negligible role in attracting portfolio investors. On the other hand, PI in Latin American economies was somewhat pulled by strong economic growth, and also pushed by foreign financial factors but not by the market's risk appetite. Based on these findings, the study concludes that PI to Asia is “hot” money since it is vulnerable to swings of global market mood and external factors, and thus can be unstable, volatile and speculative.},

We predict that a wave of investor sentiment has larger effects on securities whose valuations are highly subjective and difficult to arbitrage. Consistent with this prediction, we find that when beginning-of-period proxies for sentiment are low, subsequent returns are relatively high for small stocks, young stocks, high volatility stocks, unprofitable stocks, non-dividend-paying stocks, extreme growth stocks, and distressed stocks. When sentiment is high, on the other hand, these categories of stock earn relatively low subsequent returns. CR - Copyright \&\#169; 2006 American Finance Association},

abstract = {This study examines the degree to which U.S. individual and institutional investor sentiments are propagated abroad. Previous studies construe investor sentiments as fully irrational; we find contrary evidence that individual and institutional investor sentiments are driven by both rational and irrational factors, with distinct effects on domestic and international stock market returns. The generalized impulse response functions from VAR model estimations show that U.S. institutional investor sentiments have varying degrees of impact on the equity markets of the U.K., Mexico, and Brazil, and no effect on Chile. Specifically, the individual investor sentiment effect is statistically significant only for the U.K market. Not surprisingly, the two classes of investor sentiments have a strong significant effect on the U.S. stock market returns. The response of the U.S. to individual investor sentiments is relatively more erratic, while the response to institutional investor sentiments is smoother. This difference in pattern becomes more visible when we consider the response of the foreign stock markets. We find significant effects of rational sentiments of institutional investors on the U.S., the U.K., Mexico, and Brazil. However, there is an insignificant effect of the irrational sentiments on the same set of countries. A direct implication of our empirical evidence is that it is important for international asset pricing models to consider the role of rational sentiments of institutional and individual investors on developed and emerging markets.

abstract = {Recently, investor sentiment has become the focus of many studies on asset pricing. Research has demonstrated that changes in investor sentiment may trigger changes in asset prices, and that investor sentiment may be an important component of the market pricing process. Some authors suggest that shifts in investor sentiment may in some instances better explain short-term movement in asset prices than any other set of fundamental factors. This paper develops an Equity Market Sentiment Index from publicly available data, and then demonstrates how this measure can be used in a stock market setting by studying the price movements of a group of firms which represent a stock market index. News events that affect the underlying market studied are quickly captured by changes in this measure of investor sentiment, and the sentiment measure is capable of explaining a significant proportion of the changes in the stock market index.Journal of Asset Management (2006) 7, 208–215; doi:10.1057/palgrave.jam.2240214 [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {We model an IPO company’s optimal response to the presence of sentiment investors. “Regular” investors are allocated stock that they subsequently sell to sentiment investors. Because sentiment demand may disappear prematurely, carrying IPO stock in inventory is risky, so for regulars to break even the stock must be underpriced. The issuer still gains as the offer price capitalizes part of the regulars’ expected trading gain. This resolves the empirical puzzle that issuers do not appear to price their stock aggressively in hot markets. The model generates new refutable predictions regarding the extent of long‐run underperformance, offer size, flipping, and lockups. CR - Copyright \&\#169; 2006 The University of Chicago Press},

abstract = {This study examines the effect of investor sentiment on the accruals anomaly. We find that for small stocks mispricing per unit of accruals is greater in high sentiment periods as compared with low sentiment periods. This result is consistent with the notion that in high sentiment periods individual investors pay less attention toward understanding the accruals and cash flow components of earnings. This effect is observed primarily for small stocks because these stocks are more likely to be followed by individual investors, who tend to have limited attention. We also find that for small stocks reported accruals are greater during high sentiment periods as compared with low sentiment periods, suggesting that managers exploit the greater overvaluation per unit of accruals during high sentiment periods. },

We use prices from the grey market (the when-issued market that precedes European IPOs) to proxy for small investors' valuations. High grey market prices (indicating overoptimism) are a very good predictor of first-day aftermarket prices, while low grey market prices (indicating excessive pessimism) are not. Moreover, we find long-run price reversal only following high grey market prices. This asymmetry occurs because larger (institutional) investors can choose between keeping the shares they are allocated in the IPO, and reselling them when small investors are overoptimistic.},

abstract = {The efficient market hypothesis (EMH) assumes that investors are rational and value securities rationally. A rational investor would value a security by its net present value; the price of a stock in this framework is based on the discounted cash flow or the present value model. Although the EMH-based model is partially successful in computing fundamental stock prices, other anomalies such as high trading volume, high volatility, and stock market bubbles remain unexplained. These models assume rational investors who are utility maximizers. But some investors behave irrationally or against the predictions, and in the aggregate they become irrelevant. In this paper, we relax the assumption of investor rationality, and attempt to explain high volatility, high trading volume, and stock market bubbles by incorporating investor sentiment into the already existing asset pricing model.

First, using bias-adjusted long-horizon regressions, we show that institutional sentiment forecasts stock market returns at intermediate horizons correctly, whereas individuals consistently get the direction wrong. Second, even the simplest possible trading strategies based on investor sentiment show clear tendencies toward being profitable after controlling for systematic risk. Finally, IV regressions show that institutional investors take into account expected individual sentiment when forming their expectations, in a way that is consistent with the view that individual investors can be a proxy for noise trader risk. However, there is evidence of structural change.},

The study examines 74 ADRs from nine countries and covers the time period between 1996 and 2003.

Furthermore, we find that the price deviation is more severe in times of higher T-bill interest rates. Lastly, we find that both, the price of the ADRs, as well as, the price of the underlying assets are more driven by U.S. consumer sentiment rather than the consumer sentiment of the country of origin.},

abstract = {Behavioral finance and neoclassical finance have very different implications about asset pricing in general and the relationship between risk and return in particular. I survey a selection of recent works that taken together generate unifying insights about the behavioral character of asset pricing. The context for these insights is the pricing kernel-based asset pricing framework described in Cochrane (2005). The strength of this framework is its integrated approach, in which specific asset pricing models such as the CAPM, Fama-French multi-factor model, and the Black-Scholes option pricing formula, are all derived as special cases. At the heart of the framework is the concept of a stochastic discount factor (SDF) used to price any asset as the expected value of its expected discounted future cash flow stream. Proponents of behavioral asset pricing emphasize that asset prices reflect sentiment, broadly understood to mean erroneous beliefs about future cash flows and risks; see Baker and Wurgler (2007). In this survey my main objective is to describe recent contributions which shed light on how sentiment manifests itself within the stochastic discount factor. It is sentiment which potentially impacts the prices of all assets, and in consequence drives the difference between what behavioral finance and neoclassical finance tell us about the relationship between risk and return.},

The "top down" approach to behavioral finance focuses on the measurement of reduced form, aggregate sentiment and traces its effects to stock returns. It builds on the two broader and more irrefutable assumptions of behavioral finance -- sentiment and the limits to arbitrage -- to explain which stocks are likely to be most affected by sentiment. In particular, stocks of low capitalization, younger, unprofitable, high volatility, non-dividend paying, growth companies, or stocks of firms in financial distress, are likely to be disproportionately sensitive to broad waves of investor sentiment. We review the theoretical and empirical evidence for these predictions.},

Proxying for sentiment using the Michigan Consumer Confidence Index, we show that during low-sentiment periods, managers increase forecasts to “walk up” current estimates of future earnings over long horizons. In contrast, during periods of high sentiment, managers reduce their long-horizon forecasting activity. Further, while there is an association between sentiment and the biases in analysts' estimates of future earnings, management disclosures vary with sentiment even after controlling for analyst pessimism, indicating that managers attempt to communicate with investors at large, and not just analysts. Our study provides evidence that firms' long-horizon disclosure choices reflect managers' desire to maintain optimistic earnings valuations.},

Our empirical model uncovers that share prices and investor sentiment do not have a long-run relation; however, in the short-run, the mood of investors follows a positive-feedback process. Hence, institutional investors are optimistic when previous market returns were positive. Contrarily, negative returns trigger a decline in sentiment, which reacts more sensitively to negative than positive returns. Investor sentiment does not predict future market movements—but a drop in confidence increases market volatility and destabilizes exchanges. EGARCH models reveal asymmetric responses in the volatility of investor sentiment; however, Granger causality tests reject volatility-spillovers between returns and sentiment.},

abstract = {This paper shows that traders in index futures markets are positive feedback traders—they buy when prices increase and sell when prices decline. Positive feedback trading appears to be more active in periods of high investor sentiment. This finding is consistent with the notion that feedback trading is driven by expectations of noise traders. Consistent with the noise trading hypothesis, order flow in index futures markets is less informative when investors are optimistic. Transitory volatility measured at high frequencies also appears to decline in periods of bullish sentiment, suggesting that sentiment-driven trading increases market liquidity.},

@article{Luo2008,
abstract = {This paper investigates whether and how futures market sentiment and stock market returns heterogeneously affect the trading activities of institutional investors in the spot market in Taiwan. Our empirical results suggest that foreign investors are net sellers whenever futures market sentiment is bullish and net buyers when investor sentiment is bearish. The two types of domestic institutional investors have poor sentiment timing abilities and the price-pressure effect may account for the behavioral differences among institutional investors. In addition, all three institutional investors are momentum traders. Nevertheless, the momentum trading of foreigners is consistent with an information-based model and that of two local institutional investors, as behavior-based models suggest. This indicates that the same trading momentum strategy can lead to different outcomes for different investors, and both information- and behavior-based momentum trading can exist contemporaneously in the Taiwanese stock market.

We look at this puzzle from a different perspective by analyzing investor sentiment in the US-dollar market. First, long-horizon regressions show that investor sentiment is connected with exchange rate returns at longer horizons, i.e. more than two years. Second, sentiment is cointegrated with fundamentals, whereas third, this relation becomes stronger, the larger exchange rate's misalignment from long-run PPP. In sum, investor sentiment's behavior in the US-dollar market closely matches with established facts of empirical exchange rate research.},

These significant relations are robust and become stronger when there are more impediments to arbitrage in index options. They cannot be explained by rational perfect-market-based option pricing models. Changes in investor sentiment help explain time variation in the slope of index option smile and risk-neutral skewness beyond factors suggested by the current models.},

When sentiment is high, future stock returns tend to be lower and vice versa. This relation also holds for returns of value stocks, growth stocks, small stocks, and for different forecasting horizons. Finally, we employ a cross-sectional perspective and provide evidence that the impact of sentiment on stock returns is higher for countries which have less market integrity and which are culturally more prone to herd-like behavior and overreaction.},

The analysis results suggest that, excepting shares of equity issues in aggregate issues, stock portfolio returns seem to affect all investor sentiment proxies, namely closed-end fund discount, mutual fund flows, odd-lot sales-to-purchases ratio, and repo holdings of mutual funds. Investor sentiment does not appear to forecast future stock returns; only the turnover ratio of the stock market seems to have forecasting potential. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {We study the extent to which investor sentiment matters for aggregate equity issuance activity. We focus on firms that are susceptible to investor sentiment and for which accurate measures of economic fundamentals are available. While sentiment on its own matters for equity issuance, it matters relatively little once we control for accurately measured fundamentals. Collectively, proxies for sentiment explain roughly 10 percentage points of the time-series variation of equity issuance beyond the roughly 40\% explained by fundamentals. We conclude that investor sentiment does not seem to matter very much for aggregate equity issuance activity. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Further, an increase in irrational optimism leads to a significant downward movement, but an increase in rational sentiment does not lead to a significant change market price of risk. These results are robust for both market indexes, DJIA and S\&amp;P500 and for both individual and institutional investor sentiment.},

abstract = {Soccer clubs listed on the London Stock Exchange provide a unique way of testing stock price reactions to different types of news. For each firm, two pieces of information are released on a weekly basis: experts' expectations about game outcomes through the betting odds, and the game outcomes themselves. The stock market reacts strongly to news about game results, generating significant abnormal returns and trading volumes. We find evidence that the abnormal returns for the winning teams do not reflect rational expectations but are high due to overreactions induced by investor sentiment. This is not the case for losing teams. There is no market reaction to the release of new betting information although these betting odds are excellent predictors of the game outcomes. The discrepancy between the strong market reaction to game results and the lack of reaction to betting odds may not only be the result from overreaction to game results but also from the lack of informational content or information salience of the betting information. Therefore, we also examine whether betting information can be used to predict short-run stock returns subsequent to the games. We reach mixed results: we conclude that investors ignore some non-salient public information such as betting odds, and betting information predicts a stock price overreaction to game results which is influenced by investors' mood (especially when the teams are strongly expected to win).},

The market turn over, close-end fund discount, and growth rate of investor accounts are chosen as indirect investor sentiment index to construct comprehensive sentiment index on the basis of factor analysis approach. The relationship between investor sentiment and stock returns in China's stock markets is tested using the regression method of ordinary least squares (OLS) and generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity in mean model (GARCH-M). The results show that investor sentiment is a systematic factor in forming stock prices. Stock price fluctuates with the fluctuation of investor sentiment, but the impact due to positive and negative investor sentiment changes is different. The impact of positive changes is stronger than that of passive changes. The volatility of stock returns caused by investor sentiment changes is a systematic risk.},

In this study we examine the effect of aviation disasters on stock prices. We find evidence of a significant negative event effect with an average market loss of more than \$60 billion per aviation disaster, whereas the estimated actual loss is no more than \$1 billion. In two days a price reversal occurs. We find the effect to be greater in small and riskier stocks and in firms belonging to less stable industries. This event effect is also accompanied by an increase in the perceived risk: implied volatility increases after aviation disasters without an increase in actual volatility.},

Furthermore, our results show that the expected FTSE 100 probability densities became significantly more negatively skewed and fat-tailed in the immediate aftermath of terrorist acts.

The effect of monetary news on sentiment depends on market conditions (bull versus bear market). We also find that monetary policy actions in bear market periods have a larger effect on stocks that are more sensitive to changes in investor sentiment and credit market conditions. Overall, the results show that investor sentiment plays a significant role in the effect of monetary policy on the stock market.},

We use a sample of publicly traded European soccer clubs and analyze their returns around important matches. Using a novel proxy for investors' expectations based on contracts traded on betting exchanges (prediction markets), we find that within our sample, investor sentiment is attributable, in part, to a systematic bias in investors' ex ante expectations. Investors are overly optimistic about their teams' prospects ex ante and, on average, end up disappointed ex post, leading to negative postgame abnormal returns. Our evidence may have important implications for firms' investment decisions and corporate control transactions. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {We examine the ability of online ticker searches (e.g. XOM for Exxon Mobil) to forecast abnormal stock returns and trading volumes. Specifically, we argue that online ticker searches serve as a valid proxy for investor sentiment — a set of beliefs about cash flows and investment risks that are not necessarily justified by the facts at hand — which is generally associated with less sophisticated, retail investors. Based on prior research on investor sentiment, we expect online search intensity to forecast stock returns and trading volume, and also expect that highly volatile stocks, which are more difficult to arbitrage, will be more sensitive to search intensity than less volatile stocks. In a sample of S\&amp;P 500 firms over the period 2005–2008, we find that, over a weekly horizon, online search intensity reliably predicts abnormal stock returns and trading volumes, and that the sensitivity of returns to search intensity is positively related to the difficulty of a stock being arbitraged. More broadly, our study highlights the potential of employing online search data for other forecasting applications.},

@article{Dow2011,
abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to explore the role for psychology within an open-system structural theory of financial instability, and to consider the implications for policy. While behavioural finance has drawn on ideas from psychology in order to explain evidence of behaviour that deviates from the rationality axioms, it is argued that the way in which psychology is framed by this approach is unduly limiting. Minsky's structural theory of financial instability, with its Keynesian (and ultimately Humean) roots, incorporates psychology into the theoretical foundations. In particular, cognition and sentiment are shown to be interconnected rather than separable. It is concluded that the policy implications for addressing the current crisis, while apparently similar between these different approaches, are in fact very different. The underlying theory involves different methodology, and indeed different framing, from behavioural finance. The way in which the crisis is understood is therefore important for policy. },

abstract = {The holy month of Ramadan is usually a time of celebration and renewal in Muslim countries. This paper examines whether or not this is reflected in positive calendar anomalies effects in Islamic Middle Eastern stock markets during the period 1992–2007. Strong evidence is found of significant and positive calendar effects in respect to the whole period of Ramadan in most countries and it is argued that this can be attributed to the generally positive investor mood, or sentiment. Although Ramadan is a time of celebration for Muslims it also can be a time of uncertainty and this appears to result in the impact of the festival not being uniformly positive throughout Ramadan. It is found that market returns in the first and last days of Ramadan show high levels of statistically significant year-on-year variation. It is argued that this can possibly be attributed to synchronization-related herding effects amplifying the impact of the mood swings associated with this period. The paper also finds that although the overall Ramadan effect is both positive and statistically significant for most countries, the associated gains were only large enough to outweigh transactions costs and provide the basis of a profitable trading strategy in one market.},

abstract = {Extensive literature conjectures that investor sentiment may be one of the important factors in explaining fund manager herding. To address this issue, this study investigates the role of investor sentiment in fund manager herding. The study employs the trinomial-distribution approach to measure manager herding, and uses the principal component analysis as the means of extracting the composite sentiment measure. The results indicate that investor sentiment plays a significant role in explaining subsequent mutual fund herding, especially on the sell-side. Specifically, the evidence is consistent with the funds sharing an aversion to stocks that have previously exhibited higher optimistic sentiment, supporting the sentiment countering hypothesis. The finding also reveals the existence of informational cascades in the case that fund managers herd as a result of analyzing the same sentiment-related indicators.},

Our empirical analysis of three largest Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) contracts in the U.S. suggests that there is a significant positive feedback trading in these markets and the intensity of which is generally linked to investor sentiment. Specifically, the level of feedback trading tends to increase when investors are optimistic. In addition, we find that the influence of sentiment on feedback trading varies across market regimes. These results are consistent with the view that feedback trading activity is largely caused by the presence of sentiment-driven noise trading. Overall, the findings are important in understanding the role of sentiment in investment behaviour and market dynamics and are of direct relevance to the regulators and investors in ETF markets.},

abstract = {This study examines the usefulness of trader-position-based sentiment index for forecasting future prices in six major agricultural futures markets. It has been found that large speculator sentiment forecasts price continuations. In contrast, large hedger sentiment predicts price reversals. Small trader sentiment hardly forecasts future market movements. An investigation was performed into various sentiment-based timing strategies, and it was found that the combination of extreme large trader sentiments provides the strongest timing signal. These results are generally consistent with the hedging-pressure theory, suggesting that hedgers pay risk premiums to transfer nonmarketable risks in futures markets. Moreover, it does not appear that large speculators in the futures markets possess any superior forecasting ability. © 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc. Jrl Fut Mark 21:929–952, 2001},

abstract = {We correlate analysts' forecast errors with temporal variation in investor sentiment. We find that when sentiment is high, analysts' forecasts of one-year-ahead earnings and long-term earnings growth are relatively more optimistic for “uncertain” or “difficult-to-value” firms. Adding these forecast errors to a regression of stock returns on sentiment absorbs a sizable fraction of the explanatory power of sentiment for the cross section of future returns. This finding provides direct support for the notion that investor sentiment affects the earnings expectations of hard-to-value firms. Additional tests suggest that this bias in expectations is unlikely to be strategic in nature. Our results provide new insight into the mechanism through which investor sentiment affects returns.This paper was accepted by Brad Barber, Teck Ho, and Terrance Odean, special issue editors. },

We find that managers’ propensity to disclose an adjusted earnings metric (especially one that exceeds the GAAP earnings number) increases with the level of investor sentiment. Furthermore, our analyses suggest that, as investor sentiment increases, managers: (1) exclude higher levels of both recurring and nonrecurring expenses in calculating the pro forma earnings number and (2) emphasize the pro forma figure by placing it more prominently within the earnings press release. Additional analyses indicate that the association between investor sentiment and managers’ pro forma disclosure decisions at least partly reflects opportunistic motives. Finally, we find that managers’ own sentiment-driven expectations also play a role in their pro forma disclosure decisions.},

This measure (which is negatively related to changes in VIX) is positively contemporaneously correlated with aggregate stock market excess returns: One standard deviation of net exchanges is related to 1.95\% of market excess return. Our main new finding is that 85\% (all) of the contemporaneous relation is reversed within four (ten) months. The effect is stronger in smaller stocks and in growth stocks. These findings support the notion of “noise” in aggregate market prices induced by investor sentiment.},

abstract = {We examine the asymmetry in the predictive power of investor sentiment in the cross-section of stock returns across economic expansion and recession states. We test the implication of behavioral theories and evidence that the return predictability of sentiment should be most pronounced in an expansion state when investors' optimism increases. We segregate economic states according to the NBER business cycles and further implement a multivariate Markov-switching model to capture the unobservable dynamics of the changes in the economic regime. The evidence suggests that only in the expansion state does sentiment perform both in-sample and out-of-sample predictive power for the returns of portfolio formed on size, book-to-market equity ratio, dividend yield, earnings-to-price ratio, age, return volatility, asset tangibility, growth opportunities, and 11 widely documented anomalies. In a recession state, however, the predictive power of sentiment is generally insignificant.},

We consider a setting in which the presence of market-wide sentiment is combined with the argument that overpricing should be more prevalent than underpricing, due to short-sale impediments. Long-short strategies that exploit the anomalies exhibit profits consistent with this setting. First, each anomaly is stronger (its long-short strategy is more profitable) following high levels of sentiment. Second, the short leg of each strategy is more profitable following high sentiment. Finally, sentiment exhibits no relation to returns on the long legs of the strategies.},

We collected data on the use of emotion words in newspaper reports on traders' affect, coded these emotion words according to their location on an affective circumplex in terms of pleasantness and activation level, and created indices of collective mood for each trading day. Then, by using time series analyses, we examined whether these mood indices, depicting investors' emotion on a given trading day, could predict the next day's opening price of the stock market. The strongest findings showed that activated pleasant mood predicted increases in NASDAQ prices, while activated unpleasant mood predicted decreases in NASDAQ prices. We conclude that both valence and activation levels of collective mood are important in predicting trend continuation in stock prices.},

Around stock splits, retail trading correlations (RTCs) decrease with stocks in the presplit price range and increase with stocks in the post-split price range. These shifts in RTCs induce changes in return comovements. In the cross section, return comovements among low-priced stocks are amplified when retail trades are more correlated and when aggregate uncertainty amplifies behavioral biases. We find similar patterns among local stocks and when firms change their corporate headquarters. In contrast to retail trading, institutional trading attenuates return comovements. },

The equilibrium price's rational term drives the asset price to the rational, and the sentiment term leads to the asset price deviating from it. In our model, the proportion of sentiment investors and the information quality could amplify the sentiment shock on the asset price. Finally, the information is fully incorporated into prices when sentiment investors learn from prices. The model could offer a partial explanation of some financial anomalies: price bubbles, high volatility, asset prices' momentum effect and reversal effect.},

It provides novel evidence that growth index option prices are affected by sentiment measures. The regression results indicate a significantly positive relationship between sentiment measures and the RNS estimated from four growth index options and a negative relationship with two value index options. The results are economically significant since an associated long?short trading strategy yields high abnormal returns with a Sharpe ratio of up to 1.1 and zero exposure to systematic risk. These high abnormal returns provide evidence of a value premium type anomaly in the index options markets.},

Using ten years data, the paper starts by analyzing the main factors that influence the variation in discount volatility across the sector. Standard deviation of net asset value returns, market value and the percentage of unquoted assets in the fund’s portfolio are found to be highly significant. As a robustness test, the whole period is split into two five years periods which has no effect on the significance of the variables. The analysis is then extended to show that closed-end funds which commit to a hard discount control mechanism tend to have lower discount volatility. However, the last finding is not highly significant suggesting that in general hard discount control mechanisms could be used more effectively to control discount volatility.},

abstract = {Lottery stocks are a puzzle: individual investors value these stocks highly despite their low average returns and high volatility (Kumar [2009]). I argue that individuals are attracted to lottery stocks because they are risk-seeking and sentiment-prone. Because risk preferences are not directly observable, I use a model-free approach based on stochastic dominance to infer aggregate risk preferences. I also use a direct measure of individual investor sentiment, the bull-bear spread, to test whether sentiment affects the returns of lottery stocks. My results show that lottery stock investors are indeed risk seekers. Sentiment also plays an important role in explaining the demand and returns of lottery versus nonlottery stocks. The lottery stock puzzle can thus be understood only by incorporating unusual risk preferences and the propensity for individual investors to trade on sentiment.},

@article{Nguyen2013,
abstract = {Abstract We draw on the psychology literature on cross-country cultural differences to explain the information content of stock markets around the world. We show that cultural dimensions in the studies of Hofstede (1980, 2001) such as individualism and uncertainty avoidance closely relate to several behavioral biases widely discussed in accounting and finance research. These cultural dimensions also signal different risk preferences. We argue that behavioral biases and risk preferences influence how international investors act on firm-specific information and empirically test whether individualism and uncertainty avoidance indexes can explain the cross-country information content of stock markets. We compute R2 from the market model to measure the general information content of stock markets in the long term, abnormal return variance, and abnormal trading volume around earnings announcements to measure the short-term information content of earnings announcements. Using more than 150,000 earnings announcements from 42 countries for the period 1990–2006, we find that the information content of stock markets is higher in more individualistic countries and in low uncertainty-avoiding countries. The relations between cultural dimensions and measures of information content are robust to the inclusion of several control variables or the use of updated cultural indexes that account for possible changes in cultures over time.},

abstract = {Abstract The systematic and important role of investor sentiment has been supported by some recent empirical and theoretical literatures. In this paper, we present a dynamic asset pricing model with heterogeneous sentiments and we find that the equilibrium stock price is the wealth-share-weighted average of the stock prices that would prevail in an economy with one sentiment investor only. Moreover, heterogeneous sentiments induce fluctuations in the wealth distribution, which increases stock return volatility and induces mean reversion in stock returns. The model offers a partial explanation for the financial anomaly of mean reversion.},
